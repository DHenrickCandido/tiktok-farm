Girls are so angry it’s just irresponsible, but I’m glad people are having fun with them no matter what and I’ll explain it this way 

despite the terrible hate le sserafim always sings and performs on stage with so much confidence, it makes me feel like you can achieve anything in life with a fearless mindset like them

my emotions are really mixed right now, i’m really proud of le sserafim and i really want to cry. this is something i rarely see after coachella and easy era, usually the comments and conversations are full of swearing and hate, but at this festival everything was different. i cried really happily, le sserafim is the beginning of everything, let’s move forward together and be better with us in the future, fearnots will be with you until the end. let’s show the world that you don’t deserve to be insulted and hated.
