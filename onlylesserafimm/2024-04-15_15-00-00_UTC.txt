‚Äúit‚Äôs criticism‚Äù no yall are downright harassing them. nd for criticism to valid there has to be a solid ground for it because shaky vocals and being out of breath after singing n dancing LIVE for 40 mins is reasonable and literally what should happen if they‚Äôre rly singing live. they‚Äôre not robots. most of yall can barely run for 5 minutes without breaking down. no matter how much training they get it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they get exhausted performing such difficult choreo while singing and 40 minutes is a well reasonable time range. yall are just on the qrts posting clips of your faves performing with backtracks so loud it overshadows the live vocals. and this is so normalized yall think that‚Äôs how performances should be, and sserafim showing yall exactly how performing live is had yall losing your heads. get help. criticism ‚â† cyberbullying. PROUD IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT üíô LE SSERAFIM SHUTTING THOSE FAWKING HATERS UP! MY GIRLS SO PROUD OF YOU I LOVE YOU FIMMIES. ‚ú®
